# 🚀 AssetTrack - Enterprise IT Asset Management

AssetTrack is an advanced, Zero-Trust Architecture web application built with the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It is designed to track monetary hardware lifecycles, assign software licenses, securely manage user access with brute-force prevention, and automatically back up your organization's entire infrastructure.

## ✨ Enterprise Features

### 🔐 Zero-Trust Security & Authentication
- **First-Mover Super Admin Initialization**: The first registered user automatically becomes the Main Admin. All subsequent users are default "Users" requiring promotion.
- **Strict Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Deep Node.js middleware completely silences undocumented/unauthorized API queries.
- **Cryptographic 2FA (Two-Factor Auth)**: Base32 Time-Based One-Time Passwords via Microsoft/Google Authenticator (`speakeasy` & `qrcode`).
- **Auto-Lockout Engine**: 5 consecutive failed logins trigger a 15-minute complete account lockout, logging the IP.
- **Advanced Network Sanitization**: Built-in HTTP compression, XSS query sanitization (`xss-clean`), and NoSQL injection blockades (`express-mongo-sanitize`).
- **Global & Localized Rate Limiting**: DDOS prevention.

### 💻 Infrastructure & Asset Management
- **Hardware Lifecycles**: Calculate financial depreciation directly via `purchase price`, `salvage value`, and `useful life years`.
- **Bulk CSV Uploads**: Instantly drag-and-drop massive Excel/CSV sheets using `react-dropzone` and `csv-parser` to generate thousands of assets simultaneously.
- **Smart QR Code Generation**: Every hardware asset automatically mints its own scannable tracking ID.
- **Software License Tracking**: Keep track of "Adobe" and "Microsoft 365" seats mathematically.
- **Helpdesk Ticketing System**: Internal users can flag broken devices and trigger repair pipelines.
- **Real-Time Synchronizations**: Instant screen updates via WebSockets (`Socket.IO`).

### 📊 Professional Analytics & Export
- **PDF Exec Reports**: Instantly render highly visual PDF documents (`jspdf`, `jspdf-autotable`) of your entire current asset valuation.
- **CSV Data Tunnels**: Bidirectional importing and exporting.
- **Tamper-Proof Audit Logging**: Every system mutation is cryptographically logged forever.

### 🛡️ Automatic Backup & API Keys
- **WebHooks & API Keys**: Generate secure integration keys to plug AssetTrack into Slack or custom CI/CD pipelines.
- **Automated Nightly Backups**: Node.js Cron job generates highly compressed pure JSON database snapshots securely into your local directory every night at 2:00 AM.

npm run dev
```

### 3. Initialize Admin
- Navigate to `http://localhost:5173`
- Click **Register** and create an account.
